## Description:
I have used array as a data structure because we can easily find the number of students and courses that are to be created.
wait and allocated courses are strings as it will be simple to add with a + symbol at the end and it can be removed by converting to char array easily.
File output is not able to write semesters and states which I really cant understand why, but you can check the output in standard display.
In the state diagram every state can transit to another state , but to maintain state diagram's neatness only some transitions are shown.
I have used 1 day of 3 slack days.
